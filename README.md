# Crowdfunding with kickstarter

Kickstarter is a US based global crowdfunding platform focused on bringing funding to creative projects. 
Since the platform’s launch in 2009, the site has hosted over [189.131](https://www.kickstarter.com/help/stats?lang=de) successfully funded projects with over 5.316.550.434 $ and 18.623.561 million unique backers. 
Kickstarter uses an “all-or-nothing” funding system. This means that funds are only dispersed for projects that meet the original funding goal set by the creator.

Unfortunately, not every campaign comes out as a winner. 

This is an exploratory data analysis of the kickstarter projects dataset for predicting if a kickstarter project is going to be successful or not.

### Data & SetUp
The dataset for this project was given by our head coaches. 
55 csv files were loaded and combined into a single data frame using the pd.read_csv function in python. 
The raw dataset could be found here. 

### Get a feeling for my data & business understanding
First of all we startedt to develope a rare understanding for the data & business case. 
For example we checked the shape, null values und the columns. 
To get an better feeling, we took our time to check each column and tried to figure out the meaning. 
After that we started with the online research to get some background information about kickstarter.
